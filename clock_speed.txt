Calibrating speed of interval timers:
  POSIX clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME) and
  inline tsc_cycles() which uses RDTSCP instruction

clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME) takes 63 nsec
tsc_cycles() takes (32 cycles) 12 nsec
Mean overhead using tsc_cycles() to measure interval is (33 cycles) 12 nsec
  [Standard deviation of estimated overhead is (1.4 cycles) 0 nsec]
